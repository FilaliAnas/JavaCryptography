  <h1>README: RSA and Caesar Cipher Algorithms</h1>
  
  <h2>RSA Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm in modern cryptography. It is named after its inventors and is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. The RSA algorithm provides a secure method for encryption and decryption, as well as digital signatures.
  </p>

  <h2>Caesar Cipher Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The Caesar cipher is a simple and ancient substitution cipher technique. It was named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it to secure his correspondence. The algorithm involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions to create the ciphertext.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage and Considerations:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>RSA: The RSA algorithm is commonly used for secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. It provides a high level of security, but the key generation and encryption/decryption processes are computationally intensive.</li>
    <li>Caesar Cipher: The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique and has limited security. It is mainly used for educational purposes and as a building block for more complex ciphers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Note: While the Caesar cipher is a historical encryption method, it is no longer considered secure for practical use. It is highly recommended to use modern encryption algorithms like RSA for secure communications and data protection.</em></p>
