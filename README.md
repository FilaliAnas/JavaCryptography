  <h2>RSA Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm in modern cryptography. It is named after its inventors and is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. The RSA algorithm provides a secure method for encryption and decryption, as well as digital signatures.
  </p>

  <h2>Caesar Cipher Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The Caesar cipher is a simple and ancient substitution cipher technique. It was named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it to secure his correspondence. The algorithm involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions to create the ciphertext.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage and Considerations:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>RSA: The RSA algorithm is commonly used for secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. It provides a high level of security, but the key generation and encryption/decryption processes are computationally intensive.</li>
    <li>Caesar Cipher: The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique and has limited security. It is mainly used for educational purposes and as a building block for more complex ciphers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Note: While the Caesar cipher is a historical encryption method, it is no longer considered secure for practical use. It is highly recommended to use modern encryption algorithms like RSA for secure communications and data protection.</em></p>

    <h1>Comparison: AES vs Caesar Cipher</h1>
  
  <h2>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Type: Symmetric encryption algorithm</li>
    <li>Security Level: High</li>
    <li>Usage: Widely used for securing sensitive data in various applications, including network communications, data storage, and confidential information protection</li>
    <li>Keys: Supports 128, 192, and 256-bit keys</li>
    <li>Method: AES algorithm employs a combination of substitutions, permutations, and linear transformations to encrypt and decrypt data</li>
    <li>Security: AES is considered secure and robust against common cryptographic attacks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Type: Substitution cipher algorithm</li>
    <li>Security Level: Low</li>
    <li>Usage: Mainly used for educational and demonstration purposes to understand basic encryption concepts</li>
    <li>Keys: Uses a fixed shift key to move each letter of the original message to a new position in the alphabet</li>
    <li>Method: Caesar Cipher performs a fixed shift of letters in the alphabet, such as shifting each letter three positions to the right</li>
    <li>Security: Caesar Cipher is considered outdated and insecure, as it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and statistical analysis</li>
  </ul>
