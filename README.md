  <h2>RSA Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm in modern cryptography. It is named after its inventors and is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. The RSA algorithm provides a secure method for encryption and decryption, as well as digital signatures.
  </p>

  <h2>Caesar Cipher Algorithm:</h2>
  <p>
    The Caesar cipher is a simple and ancient substitution cipher technique. It was named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it to secure his correspondence. The algorithm involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions to create the ciphertext.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage and Considerations:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>RSA: The RSA algorithm is commonly used for secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. It provides a high level of security, but the key generation and encryption/decryption processes are computationally intensive.</li>
    <li>Caesar Cipher: The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique and has limited security. It is mainly used for educational purposes and as a building block for more complex ciphers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Note: While the Caesar cipher is a historical encryption method, it is no longer considered secure for practical use. It is highly recommended to use modern encryption algorithms like RSA for secure communications and data protection.</em></p>

    <h2>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</h2>
  
  <h2>Key Expansion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AES uses a secret key of 128, 192, or 256 bits.</li>
    <li>A series of round keys is generated from the original key.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Substitution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each byte of the data is substituted with another byte using a substitution table (S-box).</li>
    <li>This substitution adds complexity to the encryption process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Shifting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The rows of the data matrix are shifted.</li>
    <li>This ensures spreading out of data within the matrix.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mixing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The columns of the data matrix are mixed.</li>
    <li>This mixing operation adds confusion and enhances security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Adding Key</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each byte of the data is combined with a round key using XOR operation.</li>
    <li>The round key comes from the key expansion step.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Repeat</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Steps 2 to 5 are repeated for a certain number of rounds based on the key size.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Round</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The final round excludes the mixing step.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Decryption</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Decryption is the reverse process of encryption using the inverse operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>AES provides a high level of security, ensuring the confidentiality of data. It is widely used to secure communication, encrypt files, and protect sensitive information.</em></p>
